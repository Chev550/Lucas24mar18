<blockquote>
  <p>This section has questions on the ‘why’ of green building</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the triple bottom line?</strong></p>

<p>True sustainability has three key aspects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Economics</li>
  <li>Environment</li>
  <li>Social responsibility</li>
</ol>

<!-- more -->

<p><strong>What design decisions would positively impact the social aspect of the triple bottom line?</strong></p>

<p>Brighter light bulbs create a better work environment for employees, and reduced pollution creates more breathable air in the surrounding communities.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need green buildings?</strong></p>

<p>Green building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building’s life cycle. That life cycle respectfully analyzes and integrates site selection through design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. The practice expands and also complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.</p>

<p>Green buildings are specifically designed structures that reduce the overall negative impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment. High-performance green buildings address sustainable development throughout the building’s entire life cycle – from the beginning with the building’s site selection and design all the way through to the end of the building’s life. Sustainable buildings are significantly better than standard buildings. They use less energy, save money over time, provide better occupant health and comfort, and are better for the environment.</p>

<p><strong>How much energy do buildings use?</strong></p>

<p>In the United States, buildings account for</p>

<ul>
  <li>36% of total energy use</li>
  <li>65% of electricity consumption</li>
  <li>30% of greenhouse gas emissions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="code">Code</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every project will have state and local codes that need to be followed. You don’t need to learn all the codes in your city. You do need to know that there are codes, and that local codes always take precedent over any LEED rules.</p>

<h4 id="values-of-sustainable-design">Values of sustainable design</h4>

<p><strong>What are hard costs, life cycle costs, and soft costs?</strong></p>

<p><em>Hard costs</em> deal with fixed assets. They are directly related to improving real property.</p>

<p><em>Soft costs</em> are costs not directly related to building, construction, etc. These include architectural, legal, financing, engineering fees and other costs incurred before and after construction. These costs make construction possible but are not directly related to building the project.</p>

<p><em>Life cycle cost (LCC)</em> is the sum of all recurring and one-time (non-recurring) costs over the full life span or a specified period of a good, service, structure, or system. The life cycle cost includes the purchase price, installation cost, operating costs, maintenance and upgrade costs, and remaining (residual or salvage) value at the end of ownership or its useful life.</p>

<p><strong>What type of cost is the purchase of the site?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is life cycle costing?</strong></p>

<p>Life-cycle costing (LCC) determines the cost of a product or system over its life time including payback periods, operational and maintenance costs, replacement, cost savings, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What is life cycle assessment?</strong></p>

<p>Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a measurement of a product’s environmental impact throughout its life cycle, beginning with extraction through manufacturing, shipping, use, and then reuse or end of life.</p>

<p><strong>How does the cost of a green building differ than that of a conventional building?</strong></p>

<p>Green building projects have hard and soft costs just like traditional building, but the project team also considers life cycle costs. Green building also differs from traditional design by considering the operating and maintenance costs of the building over its lifetime, not just the construction costs.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="regional-design">Regional design</h4>

<p><strong>What climates are not good for a high reflectance roof?</strong></p>

<p>Cold climates.</p>

<p>In warm and sunny climates highly emissive roof products can help reduce the cooling load on the building by releasing the remaining heat absorbed from the sun. There is also evidence that low emissivity may benefit those buildings located in colder climates by retaining heat and reducing the heating load.</p>

<p><strong>What are regional priority credits?</strong></p>

<p>Regional Priority acknowledges that different regions in the world have different needs and has selected existing credits in the rating systems that should be a priority. Regional Priority credits are listed by country, state and zip code. The intent of the regional priority credits and points is to encourage teams to attempt LEED credits that address specific environmental priorities in the project’s region. Teams can only earn up to 4 points in this category.</p>
